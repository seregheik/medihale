                        with the fees, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time a
                        fee or charge is due and payable. Unless otherwise stated, all

                        you are ultimately charged. Please check with your employer,
                        health plan or agency to determine if any Services will be
                        reimbursed. If you do not have insurance coverage for the
                        Services, or if your cover is denied, you acknowledge and agree

                        insurer or other payor would have paid for the scheduled services
                        if you do not cancel a scheduled appointment at least 24 hours in
